# Changelog

Changelog for Cass Operator, new PRs should update the `main / unreleased` section with entries in the order:

```markdown
* [CHANGE]
* [FEATURE]
* [ENHANCEMENT]
* [BUGFIX]
```

## unreleased

* [CHANGE] [#566](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/566) BREAKING: StatefulSets will no longer be automatically updated if CassandraDatacenter is not modified, unless an annotation "cassandra.datastax.com/autoupdate-spec" is set to the CassandraDatacenter with value "always" or "once". This means users of config secret should set this variable to "always" to keep their existing behavior. For other users, this means that for example the upgrades of operator will no longer automatically apply updated settings or system-logger image. The benefit is that updating the operator no longer causes the cluster to have a rolling restart. A new condition to indicate such change could be necessary is called "RequiresUpdate" and it will be set to True until the next refresh of reconcile has happened. 
* [CHANGE] [#618](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/618) Update dependencies to support controller-runtime 0.17.2, modify required parts.

## v1.17.1

* [CHANGE] [#541](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/541) Revert when deployed through OLM, add serviceAccount to Cassandra pods that use nonroot priviledge. This is no longer necessary with 1.17.0 and up.

## v1.17.0

* [CHANGE] [#565](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/565) Replace the use of wget with curl when making Kubernetes -> management-api HTTP(S) calls
* [CHANGE] [#553](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/553) dockerImageRunsAsCassandra is no longer used for anything as that's the default for current images. Use SecurityContext to override default SecurityContext (999:999)

* [ENHANCEMENT] [#512](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/512) Configs are now built using the newer k8ssandra-client config build command instead of the older cass-config-builder. This provides support for Cassandra 4.1.x config properties and to newer.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#184](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/184) Implement metrics to indicate the status of the Datacenter pods. Experimental, these metric names and values could be changed in the future versions.

## v1.16.0

* [CHANGE] [#531](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/531) Update to Kubebuilder gov4-alpha layout structure
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#523](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/516) Spec.ServiceAccountName is introduced as replacements to Spec.ServiceAccount (to account for naming changes in Kubernetes itself), also PodTemplateSpec.Spec.ServiceAccountName is supported. Precendence order is: Spec.ServiceAccountName > Spec.ServiceAccount > PodTemplateSpec.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#541](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/541) When deployed through OLM, add serviceAccount to Cassandra pods that use nonroot priviledge

## v1.10.6

* [CHANGE] [#496](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/496) ScalingUp is no longer tied to the lifecycle of the cleanup job. The cleanup job is created after the ScaleUp has finished, but to track its progress one should check the status of the CassandraTask and not the CassandraDatacenter's status. Also, added a new annotation to the Datacenter "cassandra.datastax.com/no-cleanup", which if set prevents from the creation of the CassandraTask.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#500](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/500) Allow the /start command to run for a longer period of time (up to 10 minutes), before killing the pod if no response is received.

* [BUGFIX] [#437](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/437) Ignore cluster healthy check on Datacenter decommission. Rest of #437 fix is not applied since this version does not have that bug.
* [BUGFIX] [#404](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/404) Filter unallowed values from the rackname when used in Kubernetes resources
* [BUGFIX] [#455](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/455) After task had completed, the running state would still say true

## v1.15.0

* [CHANGE] [#496](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/496) ScalingUp is no longer tied to the lifecycle of the cleanup job. The cleanup job is created after the ScaleUp has finished, but to track its progress one should check the status of the CassandraTask and not the CassandraDatacenter's status. Also, added a new annotation to the Datacenter "cassandra.datastax.com/no-cleanup", which if set prevents from the creation of the CassandraTask.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#500](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/500) Allow the /start command to run for a longer period of time (up to 10 minutes), before killing the pod if no response is received. This is intermediate solution until we can correctly detect from the pod that the start is not proceeding correctly.

* [CHANGE] [#442](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/442) Deprecate old internode-encryption storage mounts and cert generation. If old path /etc/encryption/node.jks is no longer present, then the storage mount is no longer created. For certificates with internode-encryption, we recommend using cert-manager.
* [CHANGE] [#329](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/329) Thrift port is no longer open for Cassandra 4.x installations
* [CHANGE] [#487](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/pull/487) The AdditionalVolumes.PVCSpec is now a pointer. Also, webhook will allow modifying AdditionalVolumes.

* [ENHANCEMENT] [#315](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/351) PodTemplateSpec allows setting Affinities, which are merged with the current rules. PodAntiAffinity behavior has changed, if allowMultipleWorkers is set to true the PodTemplateSpec antiAffinity rules are copied as is, otherwise merged with current restrictions. Prevent usage of deprecated rack.Zone (use topology.kubernetes.io/zone label instead), but allow removal of Zone.
* [BUGFIX] [#410](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/410) Fix installation in IPv6 only environment

## v1.1.0

* #27 Added a helm chart to ease installing.
* #23 #37 #46 Added a validating webhook for CassandraDatacenter.
* #43 Emit more events when reconciling a CassandraDatacenter.
* #47 Support `nodeSelector` to pin database pods to labelled k8s worker nodes.
* #22 Refactor towards less code listing pods.
* Several integration tests added.

## v1.0.0

* Project renamed to `cass-operator`.
* KO-281 Node replace added.
* KO-310 The operator will work to revive nodes that fail readiness for over 10 minutes
  by deleting pods.
* KO-317 Rolling restart added.
* K0-83 Stop the cluster more gracefully.
* KO-329 API version bump to v1beta1.

## v0.9.0

* KO-146 Create a secret for superuser creation if one is not provided.
* KO-288 The operator can provision Cassandra clusters using images from
  <https://github.com/datastax/management-api-for-apache-cassandra> and the primary
  CRD the operator works on is a `v1alpha2` `cassandra.datastax.com/CassandraDatacenter`
* KO-210 Certain `CassandraDatacenter` inputs were not rolled out to pods during
  rolling upgrades of the cluster. The new process considers everything in the
  statefulset pod template.
* KO-276 Greatly improved integration tests on real KIND / GKE Kubernetes clusters
  using Ginkgo.
* KO-223 Watch fewer Kubernetes resources.
* KO-232 Following best practices for assigning seed nodes during cluster start.
* KO-92 Added a container that tails the system log.

## v0.4.1

* KO-190 Fix bug introduced in v0.4.0 that prevented scaling up or deleting
  datacenters.
* KO-177 Create a headless service that includes pods that are not ready. While
  this is not useful for routing CQL traffic, it can be helpful for monitoring
  infrastructure like Prometheus that would like to attempt to collect metrics
  from pods even if they are unhealthy, and which can tolerate connection
  failure.

## v0.4.0

* KO-97  Faster cluster deployments
* KO-123 Custom CQL super user. Clusters can now be provisioned without the
  publicly known super user `cassandra` and publicly known default password
  `cassandra`.
* KO-42  Preliminary support for DSE upgrades
* KO-87  Preliminary support for two-way SSL authentication to the DSE
  management API. At this time, the operator does not automatically create
  certificates.
* KO-116 Fix pod disruption budget calculation. It was incorrectly calculated
  per-rack instead of per-datacenter.
* KO-129 Provide `allowMultipleNodesPerWorker` parameter to enable testing
  on small k8s clusters.
* KO-136 Rework how DSE images and versions are specified.

## v0.3.0

* Initial labs release.
