Changelog for Cass Operator, new PRs should update the `main / unreleased` section with entries in the order:

```markdown
* [CHANGE]
* [FEATURE]
* [ENHANCEMENT]
* [BUGFIX]
```

## unreleased

* [BUGFIX] [#765](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/765) Fix CheckRackPodLabels to use statefulSet.Spec.Replicas instead of .Status.Replicas to verify all the current pods and their labels
* [BUGFIX] [#751](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/751) If datacenterName == "", do not use it as accepted value, threat it the same way as nil value

## v1.23.0

* [CHANGE] [#720](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/720) Always use ObjectMeta.Name for the PodDisruptionBudget resource name, not the DatacenterName
* [CHANGE] [#731](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/731) Make the concurrent restart of already bootstrapped nodes the default. If user wishes to revert to older behavior, set annotation ``cassandra.datastax.com/allow-parallel-starts: "false"`` to datacenter.
* [FEATURE] [#651](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/651) Add tsreload task for DSE deployments and ability to check if sync operation is available on the mgmt-api side
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#722](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/722) Add back the ability to track cleanup task before marking scale up as done. This is controlled by an annotation cassandra.datastax.com/track-cleanup-tasks
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#532](https://github.com/k8ssandra/k8ssandra-operator/issues/532) Extend ImageConfig type to allow additional parameters for k8ssandra-operator requirements. These include per-image PullPolicy / PullSecrets as well as additional image.  Also add ability to override a single HCD version image. 
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#636](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/636) Add support for new field in ImageConfig, imageNamespace. This will allow to override namespace of all images when using private registries. Setting it to empty will remove the namespace entirely.
* [BUGFIX] [#705](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/705) Ensure ConfigSecret has annotations map before trying to set a value

## v1.22.4

* [BUGFIX] [#708](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/708) Preserve existing SecurityContext when ReadOnlyRootFilesystem is set

## v1.22.3

* [FEATURE] [#701](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/701) Allow ReadOnlyRootFilesystem for DSE also with extra mounts to provide support for cass-config-builder setups

* [CHANGE] [#689](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/689) Allow k8ssandra.io labels and annotations in services config

## v1.22.0

* [FEATURE] [#263](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/263) Allow increasing the size of CassandraDataVolumeClaimSpec if the selected StorageClass supports it. This feature is currently behind a opt-in feature flag and requires an annotation ``cassandra.datastax.com/allow-storage-changes: true`` to be set in the CassandraDatacenter.
* [FEATURE] [#646](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/646) Allow starting multiple parallel pods if they have already previously bootstrapped and not planned for replacement. Set annotation ``cassandra.datastax.com/allow-parallel-starts: true`` to enable this feature.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#648](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/648) Make MinReadySeconds configurable value in the Spec.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#184](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/349) Add CassandraDatacenter.Status fields as metrics also
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#199](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/199) If .spec.readOnlyRootFilesystem is set, run the cassandra container with readOnlyRootFilesystem. Also, modify the default SecurityContext to mention runAsNonRoot: true

* [BUGFIX] [#681](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/681) Remove nodes rights from the operator as it is not required

## v1.21.1

* [BUGFIX] [#665](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/665) The RequiresUpdate and ObservedGenerations were updated too often, even when the reconcile was not finished.

## v1.21.0

* [FEATURE] [#659](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/659) Add support for HCD serverType with versions 1.x.x. It will be deployed like Cassandra >= 4.1 for now.
* [FEATURE] [#660](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/660) Add support for DSE version 6.9.x and remove support for DSE 7.x.x. DSE 6.9 will be deployed like DSE 6.8.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#663](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/663) Update k8ssandra-client for better Cassandra 5.0 config support
* [BUGFIX] [#652](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/652) Update nodeStatuses info when a pod is recreated
* [BUGFIX] [#656](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/656) After canary upgrade, it was not possible to continue upgrading rest of the nodes if the only change was removing the canary upgrade
* [BUGFIX] [#657](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/657) If a change did not result in StatefulSet changes, a Ready -> Ready state would lose an ObservedGeneration update in the status
* [BUGFIX] [#382](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/382) If StatefulSet has not caught up yet, do not allow any changes to it. Instead, requeue and wait (does not change behavior of forceRacksUpgrade)

## v1.20.0

* [CHANGE] [#566](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/566) BREAKING: StatefulSets will no longer be automatically updated if CassandraDatacenter is not modified, unless an annotation "cassandra.datastax.com/autoupdate-spec" is set to the CassandraDatacenter with value "always" or "once". This means users of config secret should set this variable to "always" to keep their existing behavior. For other users, this means that for example the upgrades of operator will no longer automatically apply updated settings or system-logger image. The benefit is that updating the operator no longer causes the cluster to have a rolling restart. A new condition to indicate such change could be necessary is called "RequiresUpdate" and it will be set to True until the next refresh of reconcile has happened. 
* [CHANGE] [#618](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/618) Update dependencies to support controller-runtime 0.17.2, modify required parts.
* [CHANGE] [#575](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/575) Allow modification of PodTemplateSpec.ObjectMeta.Labels (it will cause a rolling restart as StatefulSet controller can't apply them without a restart)
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#628](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/628) Replace pod task can replace any node, including those that have crashed
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#532](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/532) Instead of rejecting updates/creates with deprecated fields, return kubectl warnings.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#637](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/637) Expand nodeStatuses to include IPs and racks.
* [BUGFIX] [#639](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/639) Remove InvalidState check, there's no need to block reconcile here. Keep the InvalidState as information for the user only.

## v1.19.1

* [BUGFIX] [#622](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/622) Fix sanitization of DC label
* [BUGFIX] [#626](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/626) If multiple datacenters are present in the same namespace, the seed-service ownership is constantly updated between these two resources

* [BUGFIX] [#585](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/585) If task validation fails, stop processing the task and mark the validation error to Failed condition

## v1.17.2

* [ENHANCEMENT] [#571](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/571) Ensure both "server-config-init" as well as "server-config-init-base" are always created in the initContainers if 4.1.x is used.  

## v1.17.1

* [CHANGE] [#541](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/541) Revert when deployed through OLM, add serviceAccount to Cassandra pods that use nonroot priviledge. This is no longer necessary with 1.17.0 and up.

## v1.17.0

* [CHANGE] [#565](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/565) Replace the use of wget with curl when making Kubernetes -> management-api HTTP(S) calls
* [CHANGE] [#553](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/553) dockerImageRunsAsCassandra is no longer used for anything as that's the default for current images. Use SecurityContext to override default SecurityContext (999:999)
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#554](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/554) Add new empty directory as mount to server-system-logger (/var/lib/vector) so it works with multiple securityContexes
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#512](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/512) Configs are now built using the newer k8ssandra-client config build command instead of the older cass-config-builder. This provides support for Cassandra 4.1.x config properties and to newer.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#184](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/184) Implement metrics to indicate the status of the Datacenter pods. Experimental, these metric names and values could be changed in the future versions.

## v1.10.6

* [CHANGE] [#496](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/496) ScalingUp is no longer tied to the lifecycle of the cleanup job. The cleanup job is created after the ScaleUp has finished, but to track its progress one should check the status of the CassandraTask and not the CassandraDatacenter's status. Also, added a new annotation to the Datacenter "cassandra.datastax.com/no-cleanup", which if set prevents from the creation of the CassandraTask.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#500](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/500) Allow the /start command to run for a longer period of time (up to 10 minutes), before killing the pod if no response is received.

* [BUGFIX] [#437](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/437) Ignore cluster healthy check on Datacenter decommission. Rest of #437 fix is not applied since this version does not have that bug.
* [BUGFIX] [#404](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/404) Filter unallowed values from the rackname when used in Kubernetes resources
* [BUGFIX] [#455](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/455) After task had completed, the running state would still say true

## v1.15.0

* [CHANGE] [#501](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/501) Replaced server-system-logger with a Vector based implementation. Also, examples are added how the Cassandra system.log can be parsed to a more structured format.
* [CHANGE] [#496](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/496) ScalingUp is no longer tied to the lifecycle of the cleanup job. The cleanup job is created after the ScaleUp has finished, but to track its progress one should check the status of the CassandraTask and not the CassandraDatacenter's status. Also, added a new annotation to the Datacenter "cassandra.datastax.com/no-cleanup", which if set prevents from the creation of the CassandraTask.
* [ENHANCEMENT] [#500](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/500) Allow the /start command to run for a longer period of time (up to 10 minutes), before killing the pod if no response is received. This is intermediate solution until we can correctly detect from the pod that the start is not proceeding correctly.
* [BUGFIX] [#481](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/481) If CDC was enabled, disabling MCAC (old metric collector) was not possible

* [CHANGE] [#442](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/442) Deprecate old internode-encryption storage mounts and cert generation. If old path /etc/encryption/node.jks is no longer present, then the storage mount is no longer created. For certificates with internode-encryption, we recommend using cert-manager.
* [CHANGE] [#329](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/329) Thrift port is no longer open for Cassandra 4.x installations
* [CHANGE] [#487](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/pull/487) The AdditionalVolumes.PVCSpec is now a pointer. Also, webhook will allow modifying AdditionalVolumes.

* [ENHANCEMENT] [#315](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/351) PodTemplateSpec allows setting Affinities, which are merged with the current rules. PodAntiAffinity behavior has changed, if allowMultipleWorkers is set to true the PodTemplateSpec antiAffinity rules are copied as is, otherwise merged with current restrictions. Prevent usage of deprecated rack.Zone (use topology.kubernetes.io/zone label instead), but allow removal of Zone.
* [BUGFIX] [#410](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/410) Fix installation in IPv6 only environment
* [BUGFIX] [#455](https://github.com/k8ssandra/cass-operator/issues/455) After task had completed, the running state would still say true

## v1.1.0

* #27 Added a helm chart to ease installing.
* #23 #37 #46 Added a validating webhook for CassandraDatacenter.
* #43 Emit more events when reconciling a CassandraDatacenter.
* #47 Support `nodeSelector` to pin database pods to labelled k8s worker nodes.
* #22 Refactor towards less code listing pods.
* Several integration tests added.

## v1.0.0

* Project renamed to `cass-operator`.
* KO-281 Node replace added.
* KO-310 The operator will work to revive nodes that fail readiness for over 10 minutes
  by deleting pods.
* KO-317 Rolling restart added.
* K0-83 Stop the cluster more gracefully.
* KO-329 API version bump to v1beta1.

## v0.9.0

* KO-146 Create a secret for superuser creation if one is not provided.
* KO-288 The operator can provision Cassandra clusters using images from
  <https://github.com/datastax/management-api-for-apache-cassandra> and the primary
  CRD the operator works on is a `v1alpha2` `cassandra.datastax.com/CassandraDatacenter`
* KO-210 Certain `CassandraDatacenter` inputs were not rolled out to pods during
  rolling upgrades of the cluster. The new process considers everything in the
  statefulset pod template.
* KO-276 Greatly improved integration tests on real KIND / GKE Kubernetes clusters
  using Ginkgo.
* KO-223 Watch fewer Kubernetes resources.
* KO-232 Following best practices for assigning seed nodes during cluster start.
* KO-92 Added a container that tails the system log.

## v0.4.1

* KO-190 Fix bug introduced in v0.4.0 that prevented scaling up or deleting
  datacenters.
* KO-177 Create a headless service that includes pods that are not ready. While
  this is not useful for routing CQL traffic, it can be helpful for monitoring
  infrastructure like Prometheus that would like to attempt to collect metrics
  from pods even if they are unhealthy, and which can tolerate connection
  failure.

## v0.4.0

* KO-97  Faster cluster deployments
* KO-123 Custom CQL super user. Clusters can now be provisioned without the
  publicly known super user `cassandra` and publicly known default password
  `cassandra`.
* KO-42  Preliminary support for DSE upgrades
* KO-87  Preliminary support for two-way SSL authentication to the DSE
  management API. At this time, the operator does not automatically create
  certificates.
* KO-116 Fix pod disruption budget calculation. It was incorrectly calculated
  per-rack instead of per-datacenter.
* KO-129 Provide `allowMultipleNodesPerWorker` parameter to enable testing
  on small k8s clusters.
* KO-136 Rework how DSE images and versions are specified.

## v0.3.0

* Initial labs release.
